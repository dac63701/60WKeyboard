## 10/30/2025 5:22 PM - Created Schematics  

Creating the schematic was pretty easy. The keyboard uses a nRF52840 microcontroller for wireless communication and the nPM1300 for power and battery regulation. These two chips make the keyboard extremely power efficient.

## 10/30/2025 5:34 PM - Routed the PCB  

Routing the board was much more difficult than creating the schematic. It was difficult because of the large number of traces that had to be routed out of the nRF52840 which has a hybrid QFN / BGA package. I needed to use this specific package because it was the only one to have the USB pins broken out. After routing the nPM1300 and the high speed lines of the nRF52840 like the USB and RF, it was smooth sailing. Connecting the keyboard matrix together was relatively easy.
